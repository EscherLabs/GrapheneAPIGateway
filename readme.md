# Pharmacy EMR

The aim for this IITG grant is to create an educational EMR to aid an interprofessional healthcare team in managing a patient asynchronously.  This EMR will allow multiple professions, from different campuses, simultaneous access to a patient record in real-time allowing them to respond to notes, orders, and comments from other members of the team as clinical professionals do in clinical environments.  This system will look and act like a real-world EMR from the user’s point-of-view but each patient will be a case created by an interprofessional team, and the system will have  monitoring functionality built in for faculty to view and comment on the team’s activity and/or directly communicate with an individual.  

The system will afford faculty the ability to build cases for the beginner or the experienced student.  A debriefing “room” will be available for the team to communicate and discuss the patient case after completion of the patient encounter allowing for constructive feedback from team members and faculty.  This interprofessional feedback will be instrumental in building a better understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each team member.  

User specific interface templates will be created so the users will see an EMR that looks familiar to one they would encounter in their respective environments.  Users will be restricted to information that is relevant to their role or profession.  

The unique feature of this system is the ability to wipe the slate clean and start the same case over with a new team without the data from the previous team still in the record.  Or, have multiple teams working on a unique instance of the same patient sim
