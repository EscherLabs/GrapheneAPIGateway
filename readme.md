# GrapheneAPIGateway

GrapheneAPIGateway is a standalone API-Configured toolset for generating web services for various connected databases and external data sources.  Though GrapheneAPIGateway is designed to work with [Graphene](https://github.com/EscherLabs/Graphene), it is capable of functioning without it.  GrapheneAPIGateway is the primary API provider for [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu)'s [myBinghamton](https://my.binghamton.edu) portal.  

If you are interested in piloting Graphene or GrapheneAPIGateway at your campus, please contact [graphenepilot@binghamton.edu](mailto:graphenepilot@binghamton.edu).
